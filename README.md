# Runners

## Problem
You have a list of runners, their race times, and ages. Create a **customer-ready** application to display the runners sorted by finish time with a column showing their finish position (ranking) within their age group.

## Input
Your mobile application should read the source data at runtime from at least one of the following URIs:  
[runners.xml](http://849fairmount.com/mobile/runners.xml)  
[runners.txt](http://849fairmount.com/mobile/runners.txt)  
[runners.json](http://849fairmount.com/mobile/runners.json)  
The application should be written natively for macOS.  
The age groups are:  
0 - 15 years  
16 - 29 years  
30+ years  

## Output
The output should include this information:  

| Name | Time | Age | Ranking |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ------- |
| Ben | 9 | 29 | 1 |
| Matt | 10 | 28 | 2 |
Steve | 12 | 33 | 1
Cliff | 13 | 33 | 2
Brandon | 15 | 14 | 1
Vini | 17 | 28 | 3
Tom | 21 | 30 | 3
Mark | 22 | 37 | 4
Tim | 34 | 28 | 4
